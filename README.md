# tabletop-club-dice-tower
A dice tower asset for Tabletop Club

Descriptions of files:

The DiceTower folder is the folder with the files that are usable as a mod. Put that folder in any location where Tabletop Club mods can go to use it in the game.

The .blend files are there if you want to edit the model in Blender. The main difference between building_file and exporting_file is that in building_file the inner panels haven't been merged with the main part of the tower, but in exporting_file they have been.
